# Vending-Machine

I implemented in Vitis HLS a vending machine that dispenses a soft drink according to the following scenario:
• The soft drink costs 25 lei.
• Coins of 5 lei, 10 lei, and 25 lei are accepted as input.
• After the user has collected the soft drink and the due change, they will press the THANK YOU button.
